Coding Exercise

Please build the following page for us to review. 

Functional notes:

* loading state while main page loads
* header floats as main page scrolls
* input field/button should be interactive
* other buttons/data do not need to be functional
* will be evaluated based on overall code quality, UI responsiveness, design accuracy, attention to detail, and turnaround time

Attached:

* sketch mockup file
* pngs of mockups
* images for header: car, X button, info button

Additional suggestions:
Please use React for this project. Please try to create re-usable components so that other places in the checkout flow can make use of the same components. You can use static data.
The 'Place Order' button should make an API call to the server to pass the order data. You can use some sample data to pass in this call. Since this is a coding exercise, it is OK if this call fails (we can verify it on the browser console).
